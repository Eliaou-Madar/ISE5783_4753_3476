Project in Windows Systems by Eliaou Madar and Etamar

Welcome to the Mini Project in Software Engineering!

As part of the course "Introduction to Software Engineering", we are tasked with designing and modeling a virtual 3-dimensional graphical scene. This project aims to create a complete system that includes all aspects of lighting and physics, such as color, rays, geometries, light sources, occlusions, shadows, reflections, transparency, camera, and more. Additionally, we focus on improving performance by utilizing multi-threading and adaptive grid techniques. Throughout this project, we apply various development principles, including Test-Driven Development (TDD), Refactoring, agile methodologies, and more.

We have made significant improvements in terms of image quality and system performance:

Soft Shadows: Enhanced the realism of shadows by implementing soft shadow techniques.
Multi-threading: Improved system performance by enabling multi-threading.
Adaptive Supersampling: Optimized rendering performance and quality through adaptive supersampling.
This project reflects our commitment to applying robust software engineering principles to develop high-quality and efficient graphical systems.
